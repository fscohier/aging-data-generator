# aging-data-generator
This is a project to create a financial dataset for further analysis.

Using the dino scraper, it creates random company names and generates two tables (customer and invoice tables).
As of now, the default value for the number of companies to generate is 100 and this script will pick between 30 to 100 invoices for each customer.
As a confirmation, a success message is printed out, as well as the number of customers generated and the total number of invoices in the invoice table.
